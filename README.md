A tool for generating JSON-formatted data from a local schema.

### Installation

Simply run the following:

```sh
cargo install entry
```

Make sure that you have cargo installed and that cargo is in your path:

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```

### Previous versions

If you're looking for the version which simply allows quick note creation:

1. You can build from source for v0.1.2.
2. Use a shell alias/function the `date` command and your preferred editor.
3. Fork from v0.1.2 if you'd like to improve upon that functionality.

I'm no longer supporting the note-taking feature, since I've started preferring
recording notes and data following some schema so that I can graph out the data
over time.

### Contributing

Feel free to make pull requests. I've been using conventional commits, but I
have not yet set up formal contributing guidelines. This is my first time
working with Rust, so I imagine there are some issues with it.
